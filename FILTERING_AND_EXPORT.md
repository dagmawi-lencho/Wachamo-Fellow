## 💡 How Filtering Works

### Combined Filters (AND Logic):

```
Filter 1: Fellowship Team = "BSC"
AND
Filter 2: Sex = "Male"
AND
Filter 3: Academic Year = "2nd Year"
═══════════════════════════════════════
Result: Male BSC members in 2nd year only
```

```
Search: "Computer"
AND
Filter: College = "Engineering & Technology"
═══════════════════════════════════════
Result: Engineering students with "Computer" in name/dept/ID
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management:

```typescript
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  fellowshipTeam: '',
  college: '',
  department: '',
  membershipStatus: '',
  sex: '',
  bornAgain: '',
  attendingBibleStudy: '',
  academicYear: ''
});
```

### Filtering Logic:

```typescript
const filteredMembers = members.filter(member => {
  // Check search term
  if (!matchesSearch) return false;
  
  // Check each filter
  if (filter.fellowshipTeam && member.fellowshipTeam !== filter.fellowshipTeam) 
    return false;
  
  // ... repeat for all filters
  
  return true; // Passed all filters
});
```

### Excel Export:

```typescript
import('xlsx').then((XLSX) => {
  // Convert filtered data to sheet
  const worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(data);
  
  // Create workbook
  const workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new();
  XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, 'Members');
  
  // Download file
  XLSX.writeFile(workbook, filename);
});
```
