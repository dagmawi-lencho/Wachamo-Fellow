# ✅ FILTERS FIXED - NOW WORKING PERFECTLY!

## 🎉 THE FILTER ERROR IS RESOLVED!

### ❌ The Error:
```
Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string.
```

### ✅ The Fix:

**Changed all filter default values from `""` to `"all"`**

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. SelectItem Values
```typescript
// Before (caused error):
<SelectItem value="">All Teams</SelectItem>

// After (works perfectly):
<SelectItem value="all">All Teams</SelectItem>
```

### 2. Initial Filter State
```typescript
// Before:
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  fellowshipTeam: '',    // ❌ Empty string
  college: '',           // ❌ Empty string
  // ...
});

// After:
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  fellowshipTeam: 'all', // ✅ Valid value
  college: 'all',        // ✅ Valid value
  // ...
});
```

### 3. Clear Filters Function
```typescript
// Before:
const clearFilters = () => {
  setFilters({
    fellowshipTeam: '',  // ❌ Empty string
    college: '',         // ❌ Empty string
    // ...
  });
};

// After:
const clearFilters = () => {
  setFilters({
    fellowshipTeam: 'all',  // ✅ Valid value
    college: 'all',         // ✅ Valid value
    // ...
  });
};
```

### 4. Filter Logic
```typescript
// Before:
if (filters.fellowshipTeam && member.fellowshipTeam !== filters.fellowshipTeam)

// After:
if (filters.fellowshipTeam && filters.fellowshipTeam !== 'all' && member.fellowshipTeam !== filters.fellowshipTeam)

// Now properly ignores "all" option!
```

### 5. Active Filter Detection
```typescript
// Before:
const hasActiveFilters = Object.values(filters).some(value => value !== '');

// After:
const hasActiveFilters = Object.values(filters).some(value => value !== '' && value !== 'all');

// Correctly identifies active filters!
```

### 6. Badge Display
```typescript
// Before:
if (!value) return null;

// After:
if (!value || value === 'all') return null;

// Won't show "all" as a badge!
```
