   ↓
2. College value stored in formData
   ↓
3. getDepartmentsByCollege() filters departments
   ↓
4. Only relevant departments shown
   ↓
5. User can search within those departments
   ↓
6. Selection stored in formData
```

### Smart Reset:
- When college changes → Department resets to empty
- Prevents invalid college-department combinations
- User must re-select department (with filtered list)

## 🎯 Usage Example

**Student Story:**
```
John is a Computer Science student:

1. Opens registration form
2. Step 2: Sees "College / Faculty *"
3. Clicks dropdown → Sees 7 colleges
